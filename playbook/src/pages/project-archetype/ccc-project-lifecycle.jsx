          The CCC Project Lifecycle provides a structured process for managing clinical projects to
          ensure they align with organizational goals, meet compliance standards, and achieve desired
          outcomes. Below is a step-by-step explanation of each phase.
        </p>

      {/* Strategy Development */}
      <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-800 mb-4">1. Strategy Development</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The projectâ€™s purpose and strategy are defined with input from external experts and internal
          teams. This ensures the project is aligned with broader organizational objectives and has a
          clear focus.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Project Development */}
      <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-800 mb-4">2. Project Development</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Detailed planning begins, including internal discussions (e.g., with Medical Affairs and
          Compliance) and collaboration with external stakeholders. A formal proposal is created,
          outlining the project's scope and approach.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Projects are reviewed for compliance with legal, regulatory, and medical standards. Simple
          projects undergo a standard review, while complex projects require deeper scrutiny by
          governance teams.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Review & Approval */}
      <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-6">

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Committees, such as the Global or Local Review Committee, formally approve the project.
          These approvals ensure the project is ready to move forward and aligns with organizational
          and regulatory expectations.
