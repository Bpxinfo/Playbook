                The objective of this comprehensive processes, governance, and compliance framework is to establish a robust operational foundation for the CCC initiative, ensuring seamless execution while maintaining the highest standards of regulatory adherence and risk management. By implementing a structured approach to governance, the framework creates clear lines of accountability, streamlines decision-making processes, and fosters a culture of compliance that protects both the initiative's integrity and its stakeholders' interests.

                This integrated framework orchestrates the cross functional interactions of three critical pillars: operational processes that drive day-to-day activities, governance mechanisms that ensure proper oversight and control, and compliance guidance that safeguard against regulatory risks. Each pillar is designed to complement and reinforce the others, creating a dynamic system that adapts to changing requirements while maintaining operational excellence and legal, compliance and regulatory conformity.
